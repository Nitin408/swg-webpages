      <h2>Q. Why did you select this particular field? What options were available to you during placements?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:I interned as a data analyst under one of the leading options’ trader in Indian Market and that is where I 
	decided to get into this field. This career will give you money, knowledge, the adrenaline rush, let you become your own boss and 
	the continuous learning about the globe which no other field offers. 
Being a UG from Mathematics and Computing , having interned at financial firms and an ex-Student’s Senate Member made me fit 
to apply for Developer/Data Science/Business-Development profiles; but I was always motivated for entering into finance than other fields.
</h2>
      <h2>Q. How did you get into Future First? What was the selection procedure?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: Futures First takes an online test for shortlisting students for the interview process.
	  The online test is to check your computational abilities and how strong your memory works. During the interview process, 
	  there are 2 or 3 rounds which are generally stress interviews. During Stress Interviews, the interviewer grills you to 
	  check your decision making abilities, how fast and accurate your calculations are, how observant you are and most importantly 
	  how do you react to unfavourable circumstances. The interviewer will place in you scenarios where you need to keep your calm and answer 
	  logically without guessing. They will also check your risk appetite and how passionate you are about things that you like to do.
	  Having no financial knowledge is never a reason to reject you.
In my case, I had 2 rounds of interviews in which I was made to do quick calculations and simultaneously answer the questions 
related to my hobbies. I was also given 2 guesstimates- how many litres of wall paint will be required to paint the rooms in Nalanda 
complex and then Howrah Bridge. I was shown a 16-17 digit number for 10 seconds and told to memorise it. After 20-25 minutes I was asked
 to write down the number ( I managed to write 6-7 digits). I also played a game with the interviewer which involved computing product of numbers. 
 I was also asked how Indian Markets will react depending on political news (for example: results of then upcoming Gujarat Election). 
 They will also ask you why do you want to join Futures First and why trading as a career.
</h2>
      <h2>Q.  Can you describe your work profile/average day for us and tell us whether it was what you expected when you sat for placements?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:I trade in Brazilian markets , hence I have scheduled my daily life according to the Brazilian time zone
	  ( which is similar to the one I used to follow during my KGP days). I have to reach my trading desk an hour before the exchange
	  opens so that I am prepared for the trade. I try to read all the news and happenings that can impact the Brazilian economy and 
	  also devise new trade-strategies. As we mostly do intraday trading it’s difficult to leave our trading desk during the market hours. 
	  We do have few indoor games for taking a break and refreshing yourselves. After the office hours I invest my time in reading books, 
	  Netflix or excercising (a good health is really valued for this job).
As I had interned earlier with traders ,this is exactly what I had expected and it’s even better to live one.
</h2>
<h2>Q.  How would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: Every day is a new day in office when it comes to trading. I sit for around 8-9 hours in front of my screens,
 but have never felt the urge to leave my desk when I have active positions. Everyone working at Futures First is really passionate 
 about something or the other(apart from trading obviously). The senior traders guide the juniors really well and we always have healthy 
 discussions ranging from politics to sports. We also have regular office tournaments such as Poker/FIFA/CS etc. The trading pit is always 
 alive and happening, because of which you will always be attentive and involved. Once the traders adjust to their assigned market timings,
 they learn to manage their daily chores accordingly. I have never heard from any trader complaining about his office timings. 
</h2>

<h2>Q. What are your long-term goals? How did working in Future First help you achieve them?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: I obviously want to become million-dollar trader as soon as possible in my career so that I can spend it on 
things such as travelling around the globe, possessing things & properties and having the same adrenaline rush even after 5 or 10 years 
in the same profession. There’s no other way better than being a trader to achieve my goals.
</h2>
<h2>Q. Any specific advice you want to give for junta sitting for placements this year and for juniors who aspire to be in Future First?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:Since, the interview process is majorly about knowing your personality , the candidates must be honest, 
observant, calm & confident while answering. One must not get into Futures First if he/she wants to pursue other fields and is just 
looking for a campus placement. This profession will be equally demanding as rewarding it sounds. Show the right amount of enthusiasm
 for trading and do not boast anything. The interviewers are really skilled and will read you before you complete an answer.
 Everything you say matters. Finally, you must know about the company and in what markets it operates. 
</h2>
<h2>Q. 7) Will you be willing to take a one to one interview for the placement seekers to let them have your experiences to
 tackle technical as well as HR questions?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:There are no technical questions usually and if I am available on a weekend I will be happy to take mock interviews.
