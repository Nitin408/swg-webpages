      <h2>Q.  Why did you select this particular field? What options were available to you during placements?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: I chose Software Engineering as I had previously interned at Flipkart and liked it there.
	  Apart from this, there was also an option of Data Engineer. I had mostly applied for Software because 
	  I did not have any experience in the data field.
</h2>
      <h2>Q.How did you get into Uber? What was the selection procedure?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: There was a coding test which had three questions. I had solved two of them.
	  On the day of interview, there were three rounds. First was a coding round. The interviewer asked three questions, 
	  which were basically built on top of each other. What the interviewers expect is not that you give the best possible
	  solutions immediately, but you can build on top of what you know and reach the solution. They try to avoid questions with a catch. 
	  What they do try is to ask questions which have multiple solutions and you can gradually make your solution better.
	  So keep telling them what you are thinking. You are asked to write the code,  in my case on a paper, just to test if 
	  you can actually code and consider edge cases. Again, writing an exactly compilable code is not what they are looking 
	  for but that you do know the basics. Then the second round was a design round. I was asked to design chess. Obviously,
	  in the design rounds there can be multiple solutions. What the interviewer is expecting is that you give an extensible
	  solution and can think of tradeoffs. To test extensibility, they might build up on top of previous question and see if
	  you how your solution holds. Think about which database you would use and why? Again this is very subjective but keep 
	  discussing with your interviewer what you are doing and why. Third round was an interview with the hiring manager.
	  It had questions from my CV. Then there was a basic deadlock question from OS. Then there were some behavioral
	  questions like have you ever faced a conflict, what do you think is your weakness. 
</h2>
      <h2>Q.  Can you describe your work profile/average day for us and tell us whether it was what you expected when you sat for placements?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:I am in the Maps team here at Bangalore. Our team is exploring the OpenStreetMap as an alternative.
	  The work hours mostly depend on the team that you are working with. For me mostly an average work day is from 10 to 6.
	  I work in close collaboration with the US team, so there are some meetings at night. 

</h2>
<h2>Q. How would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work life balance?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:The work culture here is pretty cool. Around the time I joined Uber, our site crossed a head count of 100.
 People here are very friendly. There are added benefits that we get like free and pretty nice food all day, fitness reimbursements, 
 Uber credits. There is conscious effort from everyone to reduce stress, increase productivity and make time at Uber awesome. 
 There are initiatives like no meeting days, Thank God It’s Friday (TGIF), team building activities. We can work from home anytime we want. 
</h2>
<h2>Q. What are your long term goals? How did working in Uber help you achieve them?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:Currently I feel that I want to stay in the Engineering side of the industry. There are a lot of learning opportunities at Uber.
 A company that deals with data of the size Uber does, has everything you need. I have learnt a lot since I joined. 
 The seniors that you will meet here are the best in the industry. I believe all that I am learning now will definitely help in my future. 
 I believe that Uber is a great company to start your career. </h2>
<h2>Q.  Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year and to the juniors who aspire to be in Uber?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: Know the basics of algorithms and data structures. You are not expected to know advanced data structures.
 Solve problems. There are a lot of websites where you can do that. Interviewbit is the one that I did for placements preparation.
 Don’t just see through the solutions. The goal is not to solve all the problems there are, because you obviously can’t do that,
 but to understand when and how to apply what you know. Be thorough with your CV. Have your friends take mock interviews around CV, 
 algo and DS. Apart from these revise OS, DBMS and Networks. Although not asked in many companies but companies like Tower do ask them.
On the day of interview, try to stay calm. I know it’s easier said than done, but try doing things that reduce stress.
 Ask your friends or family to fill in your preference order for you. Get nice sleep as you might have to wake up pretty
 early and interviews are held throughout the day. Keep copies of CV beforehand. Even if you get rejected somewhere, don’t lose hope.
 There are a lot of companies that come for Software Engineers. Also, most companies hire off campus. You can apply later if you are
 really interested in a company with better preparation. Just go through all the interviews with the best that you can. Support your friends.
 All the best!! :)
