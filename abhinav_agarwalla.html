      <h2>Q. Why did you select this particular field? What options were available to you during placements?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:For a data scientist, many options are available from the placement perspective. However, 
	  most of them are related to finance, banking, consulting domains. For someone interested in data scientist from a product 
	  perspective at a technology company, there are few options.
</h2>
      <h2>Q. How did you get into Microsoft? What was the selection procedure?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: The hiring process was indeed simple and straight forward. If you have been doing data science for a year
	  or more and understand machine learning algorithms (note: algorithms and not techniques) in depth, things would be easier.
	  That being said, familiarity with algorithms and ability to come up with innovative solutions to very specific business problems 
	  would help a lot.
The selection procedure involves the usual written tests based on data science, algorithms and multiple rounds of face to face interviews.
</h2>
      <h2>Q. Can you describe your work profile/average day for us and tell us whether it was what you expected when you sat for placements?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: Overall, my work involves a combination of data science and software engineering. 
	  The work profile is as expected out of a data scientist at a company. I had not interned at any company before which is why 
	  I felt certain elements to be very different.
</h2>
<h2>Q.  How would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work life balance?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: I feel that work life balance as well as the work culture is really great at Microsoft. 
You get ample of time to pursue your self interests at home. Everybody around you is helpful, friendly and work won't feel like work.
</h2>

<h2>Q. What are your long term goals? How did working at Microsoft help you achieve them?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: I believe this is just the start of my career. It is too early to tell if working at Microsoft would help
 in the long run or not. From the few months that I have spent here, I have learned a lot when it comes to designing systems that 
 integrate machine learning models, business logic and package it together into production.
</h2>
<h2>Q. Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year and to the juniors who aspire to be in Microsoft?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: You must have read this multiple times. Go through the fundamentals in depth. Even though they seem basic or easy, 
they can sometimes be very hard to answer correctly. Apart from data science, pay special attention to algorithms, data structures and statistics.
Feel free to contact me for any specific questions one might have.
