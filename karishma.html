      <h2>Q. Can you elaborate the process for companies interviews?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:JP Morgan Global Market Research profile conducted 2 rounds, one was skype
based with one of the heads sitting in Mumbai, another one was face to face. Generally each round lasted for 45-60 mins each.
 Both the rounds were a mix of HR, CV and CFA/stock market related questions.They look out for people who have the passion to
 be in this field. Have a good knowledge about the current affairs. One should also be aware about how different economic relationships
 are related. For instance, I was asked how repo rate cut will impact the economy and how INR depreciation would impact different sectors.
</h2>
      <h2>Q. Could you list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion 
	  in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: My interview started with basic HR questions and the interviewer then moved onto
my CV. I was asked to explain my role in each internship in detail.Even though my
MSc Thesis was an ongoing project, I was asked extensively about it. In case you
have done any work related to economy/sector specific, be thorough with each
and every current affair and its impact. CFA related questions: Types of financial statements, walk me through DCF valuation and formulas.
 How will increase in WACC impact the value of a firm. If Equity/Debt increases, how will WACC change? Given two firms, which multiple 
 to use P/B, P/E, EV/EBITDA etc. If you are a CFA Candidate, I would suggest you to be thorough with CFA L1 and L2 equity
 section (specifically the multiples chapter from L2 and Valuations from L1) Look out for investment banking interview questions.
</h2>
      <h2>Q. What are things students sitting for placements can do to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:While preparing your CV, don’t exaggerate a lot, even if it is programming languages/software/subjects.
	  In case you write, make sure to defend any sort of
question that come across. Start off with CAT material. Try to enhance your speed. The questions asked during most of the tests are 
very easy but requires pace. Brush up your statistics, regression, ML, Probability based questions. For JPM Global Research: Market
news, economy related. They asked us to write a 450 word essay on “how to bring
GDP growth in India while controlling inflation” For CS/UBS: first three chapters
from Jain Iyengar is a must. For EXL: CAT and speed. For Walmart/UBS: Regression, Matrices, ML. Solving as many puzzles as possible always help.
 It broadens your mind-set well before. The puzzles should be on your fingertips. Try solving output based questions (coding) because many 
 companies ask questions related to it during tests. Having a rough idea about functions, arrays, pointers and strings will do. Be confident 
 about the work you did, prepare HR answers well before, cross check it every now and then. All they look out for is your interest and confidence.
 Even if you have failed somewhere, be humble to accept it. Be confident about youranswers. They will try to misguide you, stick to your assumptions, your thoughts, don’t get driven away. Lastly, placement procedure is nerve wrecking. It will test your patience at all
times. Be it tests, getting shortlisted in few companies, or being rejected by a company. Always have patience and try to crack the very first interview you get hold on. You never know when you will get a second chance and whether you will be selected in that firm or not.
