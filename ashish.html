      <h2>Q. Why did you select this particular field? What options were available to you during placements?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:I could choose among the popular fields like software, hardware, finance etc. But I was not much interested 
	  in software and as I was in Electrical so I thought hardware(VLSI) will be the best option for me. There were many companies for 
	  VLSI field like Qualcomm, Intel, Texas Instruments, Mentor Graphics, Synopsys etc.
</h2>
      <h2>Q. What is the Selection Procedure?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: There was a written test which is having questions from VLSI, aptitude and some basic coding.
	  After I got selected for the interview, I had gone through 2 technical interviews and 1 HR interview.   
</h2>
      <h2>Q. How to prepare for them?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:I have expected to explore the different fields of VLSI but in QUALCOMM I need to work on a particular thing. 
	  But it is a good thing for a career perspective as you are gonna be master in that field.</h2>
<h2>Q. How would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work life balance?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: Work culture is pretty good, we have variable working hours and no dress code.
 The main thing is we need to complete the given task within the time, they are very strict about it. 
</h2>

<h2>Q. Any advice?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: Be confident and prepare the basics as only fundamental questions will be asked. 
Also, revise Programming and Data Structures for the coding part and go through some basic interview puzzles besides the core</h2>
<h2>Q. Will you be willing to take a one to one interview for the placement seekers to let them have your experiences to tackle 
technical as well as HR questions?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: Yes, I can help whoever wants to appear in VLSI companies.</h2>
