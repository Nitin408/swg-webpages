      <h2>Q. Who are you?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:My name is Jitendra Jangid. I’m native to Degana (Nagaur, Rajasthan). I completed my B.Tech in Civil
	  Engineering at IIT Kharagpur (2018). Currently, I am placed at ZS Associates, New Delhi, India office in Data Science Profile.
	  I wrote two research papers in Machine Learning & Finance during my graduation period, presented all of these in the international
	  conferences and got it published in IUP Publications.  

</h2>
      <h2>Q. Why did you select this particular field? What options were available to you during placements?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:From my third year, I started exploring many things like coding, finance, data science. Finally after participation 
	  in many competitions and attending some of the conferences I selected Data Science as a career option and went forward with the same. 
I was from Civil Eng. so not much options were available for me. However, I got shortlisted in JPMorgan (Quant Analyst), 
Innovaccer (Data Science), Amplus (Data Science), OYO rooms etc.
 </h2>
      <h2>Q. How did you get into ZS? What was the selection procedure?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:ZS shortlisting procedure was different than other companies. ZS yearly conducts a hiring hackathon among 
	  all IITs to shortlist the candidates for further interviews. Last year, they shortlisted around 11 candidates from IIT Kharagpur
	  for final interviews.
For me, they took three rounds of interviews. 
 
Round 1: Presentation of online competition problem and Interviewer gave me one another case study problem (Business problem-related to 
 Machine learning). (Duration: 1 hr)
Round 2: It was a telephonic interview. The interviewer asked me all the questions from my CV. (Duration: 1 hr)
Round 3: All about Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms which I'd mentioned in my CV.
</h2>
<h2>Q.  Can you describe your work profile/average day for us and tell us whether it was what you expected when you sat for placements?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: My work profile is completely related to Data Science which I wanted.
 Here we daily solve complex problems using NLP (mostly) and many other techniques of ML for pharma clients.
 The data here we handle is mostly unstructured data. Till now I’ve learned many things which I didn’t know before.
 I’d say that it is totally what I expected when I sat for placements and ZS was a dream company for me when I was preparing for placements.
</h2>

<h2>Q. How would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:ZS work culture is amazing. The best thing I liked about ZS is the ZS people. They are very helpful. And another thing,
 ZS provides leadership opportunities to their employees. Plus you get free breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner (all free), free transport,
 regular visits by nutritionist, eye check-ups and once a year full health checkup (all free of cost!)
Work-life balance: I’d say if you can complete your work in given deadline then you can easily balance it and, you’ll get ample amount of
 time to explore your interests.
 </h2>
<h2>Q. What are your long-term goals? How did working in ZS ASSOCIATES help you achieve them?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:At this moment I can’t comment on my long-term goals. But one thing I can say is that I’m really enjoying what
 I’m doing here. I love data science and I can improve my skill sets while working with ZS.
</h2>
<h2>Q. Any specific advice you want to give for junta sitting for placements this year and for juniors who aspire to be in ZS ASSOCIATES?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:Make your final presentation (for final interviews) very impressive because in every round you’ll be asked questions from your presentation.
Don’t make your CV fake. Write only those things on which you are confident. For example, if you know only the basics of CNN and never implemented it then don’t write it. Because they’ll ask everything about CNN if you’ve mentioned it in your CV.
Make sure you’ve included good projects/competitions/conferences related to data science in your CV.
Make short notes of all the ML/DL algorithms which you’ve included in your CV. It’ll be very helpful in revision time.
Be confident about what you’re saying in interviews. Confidence is a key to success. If you don’t know something then confidently say I don’t know. Don’t try to bluff the interviewer.
All the best!

</h2>
<h2>Q. Will you be willing to take a one to one interview for the placement seekers to let them have your experiences to tackle technical as well as HR questions?

</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:Yes sure. You can reach out to me at 9933915716 and feel free to ping me on facebook.

Thanks!!
