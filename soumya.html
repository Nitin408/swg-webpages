      <h2>Q.Why did you select this particular field? 
 </h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:At the end of first year I changed my Department to Financial Engineering and the sole reason was 
	  I bit interested in the financie since Finance is an ever changing and Evolving field,also it is highly Quantitative field but 
	  as I changed my department to Financial Engineering, I found other domains like Data Science and Machine Learning to be fascinating 
	  enough to keep my interests alive.
</h2>
      <h2>Q. What options were available to you during placements?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:During placements I was aiming for field which is much more quant oriented be it Data Scienice or
	  Quatitative FInance. Other options that were availabe to be were Barclays, Credit Suisse, Mercari although GS was my first 
	  preference since the role was Aligned to my interests
</h2>
      <h2>Q.How did you get into Goldman Sachs? What was the selection procedure?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:The selection procedure is straight forward, the  take an online test which comprises of 3 section Algo DS, Quant and Machine Learning. In order to get shortlisted you need to perform good in Any of the two sections and Depending on your performance different teams in GS will shortlist you.
As for the interview.
Most firms have 2-3 rounds but for GS it can vary from 2-7 rounds depending on the number of teams you have been shortlisted in. The interview is unconventional in a sense that there was no HR round, only technical round.
For the preparation
1. Revised the important concepts of Probability and Statistics, Stochastic Process,Time Series and Regression and, Algorithms and Data Structures.
2. Went through basic of Machine Learning (Andrew NG Course).
3. Solved a lot of puzzles from Heard on the Street, Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability, Brilliant and Numerous CSE Blogs.
4. I also revised my notes from courses that were taught in Financial Engineering.
5. Prepared throughly for interview (CV Prep) so that I am able to explain each and everything in my CV.

<h2>Q. Can you describe your work profile/average day for us and tell us whether it was what you expected when you sat for placements?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: I am selected as analyst in Operations Division in Central Business Intelligence team. My team is responsible
 for delivering  Data driven / Analaytical solution for solving operational problems, but most of the work is centered around Data 
 Science and Machine Learning, The work can involve building a ML model to Data engineering work.
During placement I expected to get a job which is more Quant and development. After working at GS my profile is similar to which I
 expected though it involves less of Finance and more of ML/DS.
</h2>

<h2>Q. What are your long term goals? How did working in Goldman Sachs  help you achieve them?
