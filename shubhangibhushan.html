      <h2>Q. 1)Why did you select this particular field? What options were available to you during
placements?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:My work stream is Analytical Consulting. To be very frank I was not very sure of which field I
really wanted to go to, from among those offered in the CDC Placements, like I was really keen
on pursuing a career in Marketing Strategies, but you definitely need a Masters for that. So, as I
talked to more and more seniors about my options at the placements, I got a really good piece
of advice from a senior, she said, “To crack the campus placements, first of all, you need to
analyze and understand your true shots at that particular job. Be very honest to yourself, while
assessing the same.” Taking this piece of advice, I did a detailed introspection of my profile, and
my shots at all of the jobs, and tried to shortlist companies that both, match my interests as well
as would prefer my profile. I majorly focussed on preparing for profiles like Business Analyst,
Consultant, Management Trainee and Digital Marketing, cause these were the jobs that looked
for profiles that had PORs, and/or some sort of management experience in the campus.
I chose the job profile of a Consultant, that EXL offered because it gives me the opportunity to
analyze business scenarios and strategize the business accordingly. The job profile is not too
technical and involves a lot of client interaction and strategy making, that well aligns with my
interests and future career goals.</h2>
      <h2>Q.How did you get into EXL? What was the selection procedure?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: While preparing for the placements, I was decently confident about my vocal skills. Hence, I
paid more attention to preparing for the tests and gaining as much knowledge as I could in the
fields that I had already worked in or were known to me.
I concentrated most of my energy in preparing for the test, by practising quant and general
aptitude. Apart from that, I also prepared puzzles, case studies and guesstimates. I also
brushed up my knowledge in digital marketing, metallurgical fields I had interned in or did my
BTP on.
EXL has a simple 2-stage selection procedure. The 1st being a written test, that has questions
in general quant, basic verbal, data interpretation and logical reasoning. The 2nd stage is the
final day interview rounds. The number of interviews you give, their pattern and the duration,
entirely depend on you and your profile.
I had 2 interview rounds, both the interview rounds included technical, CV based and HR
questions. The technical questions mainly comprise of puzzles, guesstimates and case studies,
whereas the CV based questions in my case were mainly concentrated on my PORs and my
Digital Marketing intern. HR questions were not very out of the box and all but needed you to be
bold, confident and stand by your point.
*Piece of advice, many people have more than 2 rounds of interview, maybe 3-4 or so. So, don’t
freak out, if that is the case with you. Also, the order that you are called in for the interview
doesn’t make a lot of difference, so don’t get tensed about that as well.</h2>
      <h2>Q. Can you describe your work profile/average day for us and tell us whether it was what
you expected when you sat for placements?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">My work profile as I already mentioned, is basically Analytical Consulting. I work in the
Collections Strategy Analytics team, in the Risk division, for a leading firm in the world banking
industry. An average day at work starts about in the afternoon, around 1:30 pm and ends at
about 9-10pm, with a few weekly client calls, depending on the schedule of the calls, meetings
and the project deadlines. My work profile is Loss Mitigation, so my work really involves
analyzing the loss mitigation strategies, suggesting changes or new implementations, and trying
to minimize the losses as much as possible.
When I sat in the placements, for this particular profile, I had expected to have a lot of client
interaction, have a diverse team to work with, grow my business knowledge and have
challenging problems to solve. I didn’t want to sit all day long, coding or analyzing data, rather I
always wanted something that challenged my thinking and my ideation. And to be frank, my job
does meet most of these criteria. So far, I have been working here for four months and I really
feel a lot more confident about my business, as well as technical skills. Frankly, when we say
we want steep learning curves in our job profiles, I am not really sure, how many of us actually
mean that or expect that. At least I didn’t, but today I can confidently say that I indeed have had
really steep learning curves in my job, so far.</h2>
<h2>Q. How would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life
balance?</h2>
<h2 class="ans"> The work culture and the office environment are very friendly and welcoming. People are really
serious and professional about their work, but there is always time for some recreational
activities to rejuvenate everyone. Neither the timings nor the dress code is very strict and
restricting, that gives you an opportunity to work in an environment that feels comfortable to you.
People here are really approachable and friendly and are always there to help new joiners like
us, learn better and develop. Knowledge sessions are conducted on a regular basis, to discuss
the business scenario, industry developments and industry break-throughs. Entertainment
activities and parties are also organized on a regular basis to relieve the stress and help people
work more efficiently. All the above help us maintain a good work-life balance.</h2>
<h2>Q. What are your long-term goals? How did working in EXL help you achieve them?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">My long-term goal presently is to work in the sector of Marketing Strategy. Which involves
analyzing and understanding your target audience and strategizing to target the same, by
developing highly efficient and targeted campaigns.
EXL has been helping me get closer to this goal each day, by giving me sound technical
knowledge in the field of data analytics, that would help me analyze in a much better way in the
future. Also, all the client interaction and the business knowledge in the risk sector help me
expose myself to challenging problems, that chisel my thinking process and problem-solving
abilities each day. Also, working in the strategy sector helps me get a better idea of the process
of strategy building and implementation.</h2>
<h2>Q.Any specific advice you want to give for junta sitting for placements this year and for
juniors who aspire to be in EXL?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">To junta sitting for placements, I’d only like to say that, stay strong and give in your best. KGP
has made you enough capable to conquer the world, placements are just a pebble in the path,
don’t stress a lot about them. Also, the luck factor plays a good role during the placement
season, so don’t really stress out about the day you get placed on. Only focus on your goal and
on the job you want to pocket. Prepare the best you can, and also help each other.
My advice to the people aspiring to get a job in EXL would be, to prepare their CV points very
well and have the most in-depth knowledge of anything and everything mentioned on their CVs.
I would suggest you guys, prepare a lot for puzzles, guesstimates and case studies, cause
almost everyone was asked an ample of these questions in their interviews.
Apart from these, prepare very well for the interviews and get a proper feel of a good number of
HR questions, and remember that, in an HR round there is no right or wrong answer unlike the
technical rounds, there is just your ability to convince someone to perceive that your answer is
definitely the most right answer that this question could possibly have.
And, lastly for the junta mentioning ML or Analytics in their CVs, be sure to get a lot of in-depth
questions about the same. So, it would be a great thing to have brushed up your knowledge
pretty well, before you go in there, for your interviews.
Also, please discuss all your questions with each other at the interviews, cause this really helps
you, be prepared to go and answer well, also it acts as a great stress burster at that most
stressful time of your campus life.</h2>
<h2>Q.Will you be willing to take a one to one interview for the placement seekers to let them
have your experiences to tackle technical as well as HR questions?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Not very sure about how much free time I would be having then, but I would definitely try to be
as helpful and approachable as possible. Also, always feel free to drop by a message about any
queries or doubts on any social media platform comfortable to you.</h2>
