      <h2>Q. Why did you select this particular field? What options were available to you during placements?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:My role at oracle is an application development engineer. There were many options available to us 
	  during the placement session, like finance, banking and consulting profiles.
</h2>
      <h2>Q.How did you get into (Company Name)? What was the selection procedure?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:  There was a CGPA criteria of 7. The screening test included two online rounds that were held at different times, 
	  in which one of them has                 two coding questions and the other has MCQ's. The coding questions were not difficult.
	  One can solve both the questions in the given time, given he/she has a reasonable practice in data structures(especially graphs and trees).

The second test has MCQ's which focused a'lot on data structures like AVL and R-B trees. I suggest you to be fast, since you get limited time
 in solving all the MCQ's, unlike the coding test. There were also MCQ's on OOPs and aptitude. As far as I know, the second test plays a 
 prominent role in getting shortlisted since most of the students solve the coding questions.

There were three rounds in the interview. This is how the first round of my interview went :
After a basic introduction, they first went through my CV and there was a discussion of around 10-15 mins regarding 
all my projects and internship. They went deep into the project that was done during my internship. The real interview began 
after the detailed discussion of my entire CV. Since I'm from computer science background, most of my questions were related to OS,
 OOPs and DBMS. They started off with few coding questions, then moved on to OOPs.
They asked me to give an ER diagram for a chat box application. They were interactive through out the session. I always kept the discussion on. 
I expressed all my thoughts and after 10mins I was able to get a reasonable solution for which they looked satisfied. They asked few standards 
questions in OOPs like "what is a singleton class, abstract class etc" and also asked me explain what is a namespace. I suggest you to go
 through "learncpp.com" to get thorough with the OOPs concepts. Then they moved on to OS. 
They covered almost all the topics in OS. The asked questions in memory management like paging, TLB etc. They asked me to explain what is a 
deadlock, semaphore and brief all the process management algorithms I know. They asked me about what is a bootstrap and also asked me
 to write the solution for the barber problem in OS. All this went on for other 15mins.After that they moved on to DBMS. They asked me to 
 explain functional dependencies and normalisation. I confidently answered almost all of their questions. I asked them for a hint whenever 
 I was stuck. This made the environment inside the room interactive and the interviewer was also helpful. After this I was shortlisted for 
 the second round.

In the second round I was asked to solve a problem for which I used DFS approach. Then I was asked to explain a deadlock in a DB. After 
that I was asked to solve few puzzles. I was shortlisted for the third round. The third round was a typical HR round, in which
 they asked about my interest in joining Oracle and the reason for not accepting the PPO from the previous company. After that,
 they started to brief me the CTC. That was when I understood that I was in.
</h2>
      <h2>Q. Can you describe your work profile/average day for us and tell us whether it was what you expected when you sat for placements?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:Yes, my profile was an application developer and that is what I do here at Oracle.</h2>
<h2>Q. How would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work life balance?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: This is a company with great work life balance. You get ample time to get trained and get used to all the
 stuff inside Oracle. No harsh    deadlines.Very cool atmosphere. In-fact, I'm answering all these questions sitting at my office 
 with a cup of green tea in my hand. First year at oracle seems to be more like college life. </h2>

<h2>Q. What are your long term goals? How did working in (Company Name)help you achieve them?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:I don't have one. You get strong in application development if you work at oracle.
 This may someway help you out in your future endeavours, incase if you are interested in developing apps.
 </h2>
<h2>Q. Any specific advice you want to give for junta sitting for placements this year and for juniors who aspire to be in Oracle?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:If you are well prepared for your placement, then that's great. If you are not, there is nothing to worry. 
Take your time. Revise basics in all the concepts. Try to get the best out of you. Be interactive with the interviewer. 
Make sure he/she understands your thought process. Have enough sleep, good food and be cool. Remember that you will have
 a tag called "IITian" for your entire life. I wish all the students sitting for the placements, very best and expect you all 
 to come out with flying colours.
</h2>
<h2>Q.  Will you be willing to take a one to one interview for the placement seekers to let them have your experiences to tackle 
technical as well as HR questions?

</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:I don't think I am experienced enough to take one to one interviews but I can help you in the process of preparation.
 Feel free to contact me.
 Anything and anytime for KGP.
