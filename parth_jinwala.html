      <h2>Q. Why did you select this particular field? What options were available to you during placements?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:I interned in my core field at Texas Instruments. However, I was not offered a PPO so that made me think if I
	  was really good at it. I kept myself open to all the options before starting placement prep and decided that I go
	  for CS/IT related field since it has more options than others. Other options that appealed to my choice were: my core field (EE), 
	  consulting and data science. I got placed in Credit Suisse as a Technical Analyst (TAs is what they call us here)</h2>
      <h2>Q. How did you get into Credit Suisse? What was the selection procedure?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:In general, preparation for the Software profile is straightforward. Practice data structures and algorithms thoroughly.
	  I practiced on interviewbit.com and GeeksForGeeks. I had to cover everything from scratch so it was pretty intense. You roughly get 
	  around 5 months worth of time before placements so you need to really plan out the preparation and stick to your timetable. 
For Credit Suisse tech. profile, there was a test that had around 15 medium difficulty quant questions. Practice from GMAT material 
and the general prob stats, puzzles books (50 problems in probability, Heard on the street) to crack this round. In the interviews, 
they take lightly on coding related questions, instead they test your leadership and management skills and how good of a team player you are.
 So even if you are not good at coding, but good with your soft skills, it is crackable.
I had 4 rounds of interviews which tested me on algorithms, puzzles, guesstimates, grilled on my CV and the usual HR questions.
 </h2>
      <h2>Q. Can you describe your work profile/average day for us and tell us whether it was what you expected when you sat for placements?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:My average day is pretty chilled out, unless there is a release scheduled.
	  I spend around 8 hours (or less) in office. The day begins with Team-meetup and discussion on general issues/new
	  features to be introduced. Unlike general perception, we don't code all day. Some days are spent in creating a system 
	  design and developing proof of concept.
</h2>
<h2>Q. How would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:Work culture is a bit slow. It is not like American banks where everything is fast-paced. 
Swiss/European people focus more on work-life balance rather than slogging hard and doing overtime.
During release (software roll-out, just like app updates on your phone), it gets hectic. But if you have done 
your job properly there is no need to worry. 

 </h2>

<h2>Q. Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year and to the juniors who aspire to be in Credit Suisse?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:Practice your coding skills well. There are lot of companies which test you on that.
 Also, don't panic. It is the last thing you want to do in one of the most crucial phase of your life. After December,
 you will become a whole different person. You are going to discover a side in you which you thought would never exist. 
 Just keep working hard. There is no substitute for that.
Thanks and all the best!
