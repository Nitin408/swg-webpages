      <h2>Q. Why did you select this particular field? What options were available to you during placements?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:During placements, the  options available include software, analytics, finance, core engineering etc. 
	  Core engineering was never an option for me and despite my interest in finance, there were too few profiles in this field. 
	  Hence, data was my first preference with software profiles being the other option.  However, even in data,  I was not too keen
	  towards opting for a hardcore data driven role. The Business Intelligence profile offered by Axis Bank, hence, seemed to be a good choice.
</h2>
      <h2>Q. How did you get into  Axis Bank? What was the selection procedure?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: The selection procedure was the same as for the other companies in this profile. There was an initial shortlist based 
	  on CGPA criteria followed by a written test. The written test included different sections such as quantitative aptitude, 
	  data interpretation/logical reasoning, verbal reasoning, psychometric profiling etc.
 There were two rounds of interview conducted last year. However, I was offered the position after the first round itself.
 The first round was mostly technical with there being three panelists, two from technical background and one HR. The questions
 asked involved general puzzles, guestimmates and from my internships and projects.
</h2>
      <h2>Q.Can you describe your work profile/average day for us and tell us whether it was what you expected when you sat for placements?
</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans:The work profile would depend on the team that you're finally assigned to. In general,  you'd be able to get some
	  exposure into business aspects and operations of the different teams involved, in addition to developing your technical skills.</h2>
<h2>Q.  How would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work life balance?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: The work culture, in general, is pretty good. However, it will be quite dependent on your immediate team.
 Things might tend to get a bit hectic when the deadlines are nearing. </h2>

<h2>Q. What are your long term goals? How did working in  Axis Bank help you achieve them?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: As mentioned earlier, in addition to your technical skills, Axis would also help you in getting insights 
and exposure about the functioning of the different teams of the bank. Also, the people are quite helpful and you can engage with 
them to know more about a particular field. This would help you eventually both towards higher studies as well as during your corporate career.</h2>
<h2>Q. Any specific advice you want to give for junta sitting for placements this year and for juniors who aspire to be in Axis Bank?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:Prepare well for the test. Do try to work on your speed. The questions were mainly basic level 
but there would be time constraints.  Apart from that, prepare general puzzles and guestimmates for the interview. Be confident 
and prepare the fundamentals well.
</h2>
<h2>Q.  Will you be willing to take a one to one interview for the placement seekers to let them have your experiences to
 tackle technical as well as HR questions?
</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans:I would have loved to help but due to my current schedule, it would not be possible.
